### Reading a line on a fd is way too tedious
<p>
The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor

For learning purposes only. There are other ways of doing this by using standard C functions.
But, at the end of this project, you will acquire knowledge about static variables, dynamic memory allocation, file manipulation and so on.

### Usage
You can compile the files with your main, for example:
<ol>gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c main.c</ol>
